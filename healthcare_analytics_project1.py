Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn‚Äôt make enough‚Äîor any‚Äîinsulin or doesn‚Äôt use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn‚Äôt reach your cells.

Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. Although diabetes has no cure, you can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy.

Sometimes people call diabetes ‚Äúa touch of sugar‚Äù or ‚Äúborderline diabetes.‚Äù These terms suggest that someone doesn‚Äôt really have diabetes or has a less serious case, but every case of diabetes is serious.

What are the different types of diabetes? The most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.

Type 2 diabetes If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.

Gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you‚Äôve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is actually type 2 diabetes.

Other types of diabetes Less common types include monogenic diabetes, which is an inherited form of diabetes, and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes ."
